AZ Devops Pipeline YAML :


It will start with Trigger the trigger can be anything a scheduled Trigger for ex : Run pipeline at a certain time and certain day ,or manual Trigger , 
it can also be something that is triggered by some another pipeline,  A trigger tells a Pipeline to run. It could be CI or Scheduled, manual(if not specified), 
or after another build finishes.
then we have a section called as pipeline it is divided into multiple steps . 
the first one is stages there will be different stages for build deploy test and so on. 
and then each stage is divided into multiple jobs .
job will run on an agent each stage can have one or more jobs also these jobs can run on agent or it can be agentless 
for example certain task does not require any agent for example if we are running a normal script let's say copy command copy this file  to that directory. 
the jobs can be depend upon each other execute this job once the previous job is completed. 
agent run a job and in their job we have multiple steps these steps can be a script or a task script 
such as a shell script or Bash script all power shell  a task such as publish build artifact,  Azure app deploy, invoke rest API.
